Marketing emails are often similar. The content is different but the
structure of the emails remains similar. You could recreate them each time in
the campaign editor but it's easier to save the individual structures as
templates. You can then use these templates as a starting point for any
number of campaigns in the future.

To create these templates, SendingBee features its own template editor. The
editor is based on components (sometimes called widgets) which you can drag
onto the plain. If you have your own way of creating templates or simply have
a few already created from elsewhere, you can either [import
them](/templates/import) or use [Remote templates](/remote-templates).
