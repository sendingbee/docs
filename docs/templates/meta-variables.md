Besides variables containing custom fields, the editor has also access to a
special set of variables, so called meta variables. There variables are not
connected to contacts but rather to the overall environment.

We will expand the list of supported variables as we go. If you have a need for
a specific variable, please contact us at
[support@sendingbee.com](mailto:suppport@sendingbee.com).

## meta.now

The `meta.now` variable contains the current time in the project's time
zone. It's often used in emails' footers to display the current year.
