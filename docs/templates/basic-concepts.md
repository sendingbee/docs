The template editor is a "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) editor.
This means the look of the email you see in the editor is exactly the look
your contacts will see in their inboxes.

#### Components

The editor is based on so called "components". A component can be a button, a
paragraph of text, or an image. The full list of available components is on
the left side of the screen.

<p class="centered">
  ![templates2](../../_assets/images/templates2.png ':size=400')
</p>

Once you pick a component, click and drag it to an available drop zone. A
drop zone is an area marked with blue background and an icon.

![templates-video](../../_assets/videos/templates.mp4 ':include width=100% autoplay=true loop=true')

Once a component is dragged onto the editor, you can see additional details
by clicking on it.

<p class="centered">
  ![templates4](../../_assets/images/templates4.png ':size=400')
</p>

If you want to remove a component, click on it and select the garbage bin
icon. Similarly if you want to clone the component.

<p class="centered">
  ![templates5](../_assets/images/templates5.png ':size=500')
</p>

##### Columns

Columns provide a way how to structure emails. As the name suggests, using
Columns you can place components next to each other. Start by dragging a
Columns component onto the editor.

<p class="centered">
  ![templates6](../_assets/images/templates6.png ':size=500')
</p>

As you can see, the Columns component has created two more dropzones within
itself. You can now use these dropzones for new components.

<p class="centered">
  ![templates7](../_assets/images/templates7.png ':size=500')
</p>

Notice that in the Columns component's details you can change the number of columns.

<p class="centered">
  ![templates8](../_assets/images/templates8.png ':size=450')
</p>
<p class="centered">
  ![templates9](../_assets/images/templates9.png ':size=500')
</p>

Each column can of course hold more vertical components. Just drag a new
component to a drag zone under the existing components.

<p class="centered">
  ![templates10](../_assets/images/templates10.png ':size=500')
</p>

#### Preview

Before you use a template, it's often nice to actually see the template
delivered. That way you can look at the template in every email client you
care about and make sure everything is displayed correctly.

The preview allows you to do just that. When you press the envelope button,
it will take the current state of the template and email it to your
registration email address.

<p class="centered">
  ![templates11](../_assets/images/templates11.png ':size=300')
</p>

As we will discuss more in the [Custom fields](/templates/custom-fields)
section, it's also possible to send the email as if sent to a specific
contact. To do that, search for the contact in the text input right next to
the envelope.

<p class="centered">
  ![templates12](../_assets/images/templates12.png ':size=300')
</p>
