### What is SendingBee?

SendingBee is a platform for managing email campaigns. You have a product,
you have customers (contacts), and you want to send them an email with the
latest news or promotions. You might want to send the email only to a
selected group or groups of customers based on their attributes or history
and customize the email for each customer specifically.

Of course you want know how many of the customers have received and opened
the email, how many of them clicked a particular link, or how many emails
failed to deliver. You want to send new campaigns based on this information.
SendingBee allows you to do all of that and more.

SendingBee integrates with [Amazon Simple Email Service (AWS
SES)](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) to send emails on your behalf. You will
still be eligible to **send 62,000 emails for free every month**
([more](/delivery-providers.md)).

Additionally, SendingBee supports the following features:

* Create and assign custom fields (attributes) to contacts. Use
these custom fields for search or updates ([more](/contacts.md))
