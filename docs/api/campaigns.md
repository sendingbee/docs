- The **canceled** property says whether the campaign has been manually canceled.
- The **waiting** property says whether the campaign is currently waiting for
**send_at**.
- The **planning** property says whether the campaign is currently being
planned (contacts are being matched using the **query** and emails will begin
being send shortly).
- The **continuous** property says whether the campaign is continuous, that
is, whether the campaign will be send repeatedly to newly matching contacts
in **continuous_interval** intervals.
- The **template_links** property contains all links found in the template.
