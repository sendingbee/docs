SendingBee separates has 3 main concepts when it comes to overall structure.
First, there are user accounts. Second, there are organizations, and third
there are projects.

##### User accounts

User accounts are created via registration and map to a single real person.
Each user can be a member of any number of organizations, including none.

##### Organizations

Organizations represent companies or any other entity. An organization can
own up to 10 projects. In SendingBee you don't pay for each project, but
rather per organization which owns the projects. Each organization has a
**plan** associated with it. Each plan offers a set of features, limits, and
comes with a price.

</p>

In general, most of the limits imposed by the current plan are soft limits.
That is, we will allow you to go beyond the thresholds but will contact you
about upgrading the plan afterwards.

##### Projects

A project can be your website, your eshop, or anything else you want. Each
project has a few properties associated with it such as the name,
description, or email address. Consider these properties public - they will
appear in emails' footers or on a contact's preference page.

Every project has also a **time zone**. Internall, SendingBee uses
[Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) but you
should choose a time zone based on your location. SendingBee will then be
able to convert between UTC and your time zone in search queries and
dashboards. You can change the time zone later if you want.
